		<h2>Part 1: DAOST Chapter 2 Questions</h2>
			<ul>
				  <li><b>Explain in your own words the point of the jitter plot.</b><br>
				  The point of jitter plot is to move the data points by a small random amount from their original place. This is a good approach when a lot of data points are on top of each other, using jitter plot we can differentiate between them easier.</li>
				  <li><b>Explain in your own words the point of figure 2-3.</b><br>
				  This figure shows us very well why is it important to choose the anchoring point of the first bin carefully in case of histograms. More generally, we need to select properly where the edges of the bins fall on the scale.</li>
				  <li><b>When can KDEs be misleading?</b><br>
				  KDE can be misleading because the eye can estimate distances better than areas, that is why the observer can draw wrong conclusions from the high peaks of KDE.</li>
				  <li><b>I've discussed some strengths of the CDF - there are also weaknesses. Janert writes "[CDFs] have less intuitive appeal than histograms of KDEs". What does he mean by that?</b><br>
				  This means that it is harder to understand CDF and we need to think more and in a bit more abstract way when we want to perceive information from this kind of plot.</li>
				  <li><b>What is a Quantile plot? What is it good for.</b><br>
				  It is the same as CDF but with switched x and y axes. It is easier to draw conclusions for percentiles this way.</li>
				  <li><b>How is a Probablity plot defined? What is it useful for? Have you ever seen one before?</b><br>
				  Probability plots are used to compare 2 different datasets, for example to check if our given dataset can be described well by some kind of well-known distribution (like Gaussian). In reliability applications different distributions are common and probability plot is a good way to check if our data follows any of them.</li>
				  <li><b>One of the reasons I like DAOST is that Janert is so suspicious of mean, median, and related summary statistics. Explain why one has to be careful when using those - and why visualization of the full data is always better.</b><br>
				  We have to be careful using summary statistics because they can mislead us if they don't have a unimodal distribution. That's why visualizing the data is always a good idea, we can instantly see whether it has unimodal distribution or not from a proper plot.</li>
				  <li><b>I love box plots. When are box plots most useful?</b><br>
				  They are most useful when we compare several distributions to each other.</li>
				  <li><b>The book doesn't mention violin plots. Are those better or worse than box plots? Why?</b><br>
				  The violin plot is better because it can show more information, as it combines features of box plots and density trace.</li>
